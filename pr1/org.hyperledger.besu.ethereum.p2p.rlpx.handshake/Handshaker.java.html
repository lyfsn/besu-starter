/**
 * A protocol to perform an RLPx crypto handshake with a peer.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This models a two-party handshake with a potentially indefinite sequence of messages between
 * parties, culminating with the creation of a {@link HandshakeSecrets} object containing the
 * secrets that have been agreed/generated as a result.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The roles modelled herein are that of an &lt;em&gt;initiator&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;responder&lt;/em&gt;. It is
 * assumed that the former is responsible for dispatching the first message, hence kicking off the
 * sequence. Nevertheless, implementations of this interface may choose to support concurrent
 * exchange of messages, as long as the backing crypto algorithms are capable of handling it.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When a party has no more messages to send, it signals so by returning an empty {@link
 * Optional} from the {@link #handleMessage(ByteBuf)} method. At this point, the consumer class is
 * expected to query the final result by calling {@link #getStatus()} and, if successful, it should
 * obtain the {@link HandshakeSecrets} outputs by calling {@link #secrets()}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;All methods can throw the {@link IllegalStateException} runtime exception if they're being
 * called at an illegal time. Refer to the methods Javadocs for more insight.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;TODO: Declare a destroy() that securely destroys any intermediate secrets for security.
 *
 * @see ECIESHandshaker
